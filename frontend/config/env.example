# Copy this file to .env.local in your project root and modify as needed

# API Configuration
# Set this to your backend URL when you have a real backend
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

# Force using mock data (set to 'true' to always use mock data)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=true

# Note: Currently using mock data by default since no API URL is set
# To use a real backend, uncomment and set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL above
